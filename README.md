Automata Network “Process Hitting” and Local Causality.  
January 2014 – May 2014.  
Individual project in bioinformatics for CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), France. Project consisted in designing and implementing new algorithms for constructing traces from very large automata networks, composed of hundreds or thousands of parallel acting automata.
